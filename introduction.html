                       Hello, and a warm welcome to my website. <br><br>
                        I am in the last semester of my bachelor's degree.I have scored 72% in 12th standard.
                        I scored 10 CGPA in the 10th standard and First position in the class. I have studied 
                        a combination of Physics, Maths, Chemistry, English and Computer Science in 11th and 12th standards.
                        With the selection of these subjects I built interest in persuing Bachelor's in Computer Science.
                        During the college year's, I gained knowledge in C language, 8085 microprocessor's, Data Structures, linux commands,
                        My SQL databases, computer networks and many other theoretical as well as practical subjects.
                        <br><br>
                        I developed some soft skills such as presentation skills by participating in inter-college exhibition. 
                        I induldged myself in anchoring, modelling, rangoli making and dance events during the college festivals.
                        It helped to learn how to handle pressure and maintain our creativity in difficult situation also.
